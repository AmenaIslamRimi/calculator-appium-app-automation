# Overview
This project focuses on automating the Calculator App using Selenium. The objective is to test the automation of mathematical series operations passed as parameters to the test method. The series can include a combination of arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

Example Series:
100/10*5-10+60
The automation script navigates through the calculator app, performs the operations, and verifies the result.
